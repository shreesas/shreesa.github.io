            <h1>Popularity</h1>
            <p>In comparing the popularity of the axolotl and the dumbo octopus, the axolotl seems to have the upper hand. Thanks to its wide presence in pop culture, especially after being featured in the popular video game Minecraft, the axolotl has gained significant global attention. Its adorable, Muppet-like appearance, complete with wide eyes and feathery gills, has made it a beloved figure on social media, and it’s widely recognized in various forms of merchandise​

            On the other hand, the dumbo octopus, while less well-known in everyday culture, has gained its own share of viral fame. Videos of the deep-sea creature have charmed internet users due to its peculiar yet adorable appearance, with large, flappy fins that resemble elephant ears. However, its fame is more niche and focused on its rare deep-sea sightings​

            Axolotls have seen broader mainstream popularity, particularly in gaming, toys, and memes, whereas the dumbo octopus primarily captivates audiences through its unique oceanic nature and scientific curiosity.

            Based on this data, we could visualize a bar graph showing higher popularity metrics for the axolotl compared to the dumbo octopus, particularly driven by gaming and merchandise appearances.</p>

                <p> The axolotl pet trade probably doesn’t directly harm the wild populations since wild salamanders aren’t being poached or taken from Lake Xochimilco. </p>
