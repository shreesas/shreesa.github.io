            <h1> Battle of the Adorable Abyss: Axolotl vs. Dumbo Octopus - 
                An Underwater Cuteness Showdown </h1> 

            <img src="-unsplash.jpg" alt="Axolotlimg" >


            <h2>Overview</h2>


            <p> In the depths of our planet's waters, two contenders reign supreme in the competition for most adorable aquatic creature. In one corner, sporting a permanent smile and fancy external gills, we have the Mexican walking fish â€“ the axolotl. In the other corner, floating gracefully with ear-like fins that would make a Disney character jealous, we have the dumbo octopus. Let's dive deep into this cuteness competition!</p>

                <h3> Axolotl: </h3>
                <p> With its perpetually smiling face and tiny black eyes, the axolotl looks like it just heard the world's best joke and can't stop grinning about it. Those external gills, resembling a fancy feather boa, add a touch of natural glamour that would make any fashionista jealous.</p>
        
                <h3> Dumbo Octopus: </h3>
                <p>Named after Disney's famous flying elephant, this deep-sea dweller sports two fins that look exactly like tiny ears, giving it an eternally surprised and innocent expression. Its small size (usually around 20cm) and round, umbrella-shaped head make it look like an underwater plushie come to life.</p>
